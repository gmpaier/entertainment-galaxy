# ENTERTAINMENT GALAXY

## Description 

+ Entertainment Galaxy is a multimedia application that allows the user to search for various types of entertainment content including movies, tv shows, videogames, etc.

+ This application utilizes API links from a multitude of databases to provide the user with an enormous library of content to search from. 

+ We were motivated in this venture because 1. Our team shares a common interest in movies and tv shows, and 2. we believed that we had the capacity to create an application that was truly dynamic and useful for those who also share this interest.

+ With this platform entertainment lovers can spare time searching for great movies and shows to watch and actually go ahead watching great content from literally thousands of options

+ This project provided the entire team with an invaluable experience in site-building and design as well as first-hand experience in interactions with big data companies. Its more than safe to say that this prooject empowered everyone involved with a boost in programming skills and knowledge that is applicable in real world career situations.
