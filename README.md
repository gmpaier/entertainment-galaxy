# ENTERTAINMENT GALAXY

## Description 

+ Entertainment Galaxy is a multimedia application that allows the user to search for various types of entertainment content including movies, tv shows, videogames, etc.

+ This application utilizes API links from a multitude of databases to provide the user with an enormous library of content to search from. 

+ We were motivated in this venture because 1. Our team shares a common interest in movies and tv shows, and 2. we believed that we had the capacity to create an application that was truly dynamic and useful for those who also share this interest.

+ With this platform entertainment lovers can spare time searching for great movies and shows to watch and actually go ahead watching great content from literally thousands of options

+ This project provided the entire team with an invaluable experience in site-building and design as well as first-hand experience in interactions with big data companies. Its more than safe to say that this prooject empowered everyone involved with a boost in programming skills and knowledge that is applicable in real world career situations.

# Usage 

+ Before using this site, please visit [the CORS proxy](http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) we use and request access. We use this proxy to get around CORS issues with calling the TuneFind API.

+ As we are using a trial version of the TuneFind API, we only have a limited amount of their data available. For a full list of populated endpoints, please see endpoints.txt

+ Use the search bar to search for a movie or television show. You will be presented with a list of results.

+ Click on a result to pull up more information. If you select a movie, you will immediately be presented with soundtrack data.

+ If a show is selected, select a season, then select and episode. You will be presented with the episode title and a description, as well as the episode's soundtrack data below.

+ Click the back button to return to the prior search stage. For example if you click on a movie, hitting back will return you to search results; if you hit back when an episode is selected, you will be returned to the list of episodes.
